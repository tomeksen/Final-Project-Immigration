        <p>
          Canada offers world-class education, diverse cultural experiences, and
          potential pathways to permanent residency. International students
          choose Canada for its top-ranked institutions and the opportunity to
          work during and after their studies, making it an ideal destination
          for higher education.

          paragraph="Before choosing a school, make sure it is a Designated Learning Institution (DLI). A DLI is a school approved by a provincial or territorial government to host international students. Attending a DLI is crucial because it ensures you can obtain a valid study permit and, in many cases, may impact your eligibility for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). If your goal is immigration, I suggest consulting with an immigration consultant before enrolling to ensure your plan is viable and current."
